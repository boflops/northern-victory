Simple QuadrigaCX Trading Bot

When I say trading, I really mean poaching..

This bot has a simple but relatively safe trading strategy, that capitalizes on high price spreads, and excellent deals from overpriced bids and underpriced asks.
The bot will attempt to purchase (pouch) asks and sell to bids which are priced under/over the (indexed) market value by a user specified degree.
It will be more likely to take profit on a sale during a short term downtrend, and more likely to make the purchase during the opposite circumstance.

I only built this because I was using the same trading strategy myself with some success, but was often missing out on sleep and forced to watch the charts and order books all day.
Making 100$ a day wasn't worth the lifestyle.

Read and understand the code and algorithm before using this, in fact I don't recommend using this at all.
