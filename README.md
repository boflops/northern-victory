Simple QuadrigaCX Bot

This bot has a simple but relatively safe trading strategy, that capitalizes on high price spreads, and excellent deals from overpriced bids and underpriced asks.
The bot will attempt to purchase (pouch) asks and sell to bids which are priced under/over the (indexed) market value by a user specified degree, under the condition that the market is moving in a favorable direction in both the total moving average, as well as the exponential moving average. 


Read and understand the code and algorithm before using this, in fact I don't recommend using this at all.
